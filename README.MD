## Installation
The installation process has been simplified. Now, it is simpler. You just have to install the plugin, drop it into your plugins folder and run the server! The plugin will automatically create all needed files.
Open "plugins/MineralContest/config/plugin_config.yml" and change the value for "world_name" to the world you want the plugin to run on, then you can reload the server and you are ready to go!
In order to play a map, you will need to run the following command: /mcdownloader.

## Commands
The list of commands is coming soon, they need to be translated into english. If you want to read them with any translation service, you can get them [here.](https://mineralcontest.fr/commandes)

## Installing maps manually
Installing a map manually is pretty easy. Just navigate to [our "workshop"](https://mineralcontest.fr/workshop/) and click on the download icon of the map you want to download. Once the download is done, just extract the folder (starting with "mc_") inside plugins/MineralContest/worlds.
And now, you are ready to go! You can start to play on your map.
